title:  E-Learning Platform with AdaptiveÂ Learning
description: An E-Learning Platform with Adaptive Learning is an online learning system that adjusts lessons and activities based on how well a student is doing. If a student struggles with a topic, it provides extra help; if they excel, it moves them to more advanced material. This way, everyone learns at their own pace and gets a personalized learning experience.
